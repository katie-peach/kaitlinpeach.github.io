I am a political science doctoral candidate and graduate research assistant with the <a href="[https://www.ou.edu/carlalbertcenter](https://www.ou.edu/ippra)" target="_blank">Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis</a> at the University of Oklahoma. I earned my M.A. and B.A. in International and Area Studies from the University of Oklahoma in 2017. 

My research interests include: public opinion on national security and foreign policy, microfoundations of international relations, policy process theory, and environmental and climate change policy. 

My dissertation concentrates on public perceptions of nuclear war risk and the public's preferences for nuclear deterrence policies and disarmament and arms control treaties.
